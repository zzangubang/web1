    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script" target="_blank" title="javascript specifiation">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.</p>

    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
