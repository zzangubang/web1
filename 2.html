    <h2>CSS</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target="_blank" title="css specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <img src="css.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
